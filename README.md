# <h1 align="center"> Brownie + Foundry Template </h1>

**Template repository for getting started quickly with Foundry projects**

![Github Actions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Local development

This project uses [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) as the development framework.

### Dependencies

```
make update
```

### Compilation

```
make build
```

### Testing

```
make test
```

## Writing your first test

All you need is to `import forge-std/Test.sol` and then inherit it from your test contract. Forge-std's Test contract comes with a pre-instatiated [cheatcodes environment](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/), the `vm`. It also has support for [ds-test](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/ds-test.html)-style logs and assertions. Finally, it supports Hardhat's [console.log](https://github.com/brockelmore/forge-std/blob/master/src/console.sol). The logging functionalities require `-vvvv`.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.10;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract ContractTest is Test {
    function testExample() public {
        vm.roll(100);
        console.log(1);
        emit log("hi");
        assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

## Working with Brownie

To install dependencies:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Use

To deploy the demo Badger Strategy in a development environment:

1. Open the Brownie console. This automatically launches Ganache on a forked mainnet.

```bash
  brownie console
```

2. Run Scripts for Deployment

```
  brownie run deploy
```
